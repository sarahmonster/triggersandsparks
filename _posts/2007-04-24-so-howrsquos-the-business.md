It’s only the most popular question asked by anyone who knows me over the past few months. And it’s always hard to answer—my stock response is &ldquo;It’s too soon to tell&rdquo;. And it really is, but I’m definitely keeping busy, and new projects keep coming through the door. Every now and again I sit back for a moment and think how lucky I am to be 23 years old and supporting myself doing what I love, being my own boss, keeping my own hours, and setting my own rules. I never thought this would be what I wanted to do, but I’m utterly thrilled that I get to do it.<!--more-->

I’ve been busy moving into my new studio and working on things here &amp; there. A few new additions to the website: <a href="http://triggersandsparks.com/project/show/54">smugglerscoveinn.ca</a>, <a href="http://triggersandsparks.com/project/show/53">harrisonmackay.com</a>, and <a href="http://triggersandsparks.com/project/show/52">a logo for Triple R Tack</a>.

Up next? More websites, more logos, illustrations, a PDF book, and a resume design special. More creative just-for-me work (I hope!), a quick cleansing trip back home, followed by my (much-anticipated, though probably only by me) official launch party! Mark May 19th on your calendars and keep your eyes peeled for details.
