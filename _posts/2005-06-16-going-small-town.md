<p>Despite the seemingly dead-ishness of my portfolio etc, a LOT has been going on. </p><p>I've accepted a job offer at <a href="http://hb-studios.com">HB Studios</a> in beautiful rainy Lunenburg, and am busily working on front-end for Rugby 2006. I've packed up and left Halifax, though it's only an hour an a half away by car. I'm working on a redesign of <a href="http://idealbikes.ca">Idealbikes</a>' website, in addition to developing a content management system for such. I'm taking karate lessons. Fostering cats. Going on road trips. Considering taking up surfing. </p><p>In short: busy! But happy! Expect updates soon, or ... when I get around to it. </p>
