<p>The winter blues were rough this year. I'm blaming it on my having lost my Doestoevsky. The Switch's website is coming along swimmingly, and I've started work on a redesign of <a href="http://kisserup.com">kisserup.com</a>. I've got another project backburnered as I don't like to have too much on the go at once, but I seem to be coming out of my winter blues and am getting back to being Productivity Girl! Hurrah!</p>
