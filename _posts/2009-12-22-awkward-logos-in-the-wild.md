Everyone (or at least, every designer) loves a good "<a href="http://listsgalore.blogspot.com/2008/06/18-logos-gone-wrong.html">logos gone wrong</a>" selection. Most of them are just unintentionally dirty or besmirched by awkward kerning, but they're <em>always</em> a good reminder of why you should always show your work to others before finalizing, just in case there's a visual you might be missing. (And turn it upside down, too, just to make sure.)

So, to follow up on <a href="http://www.triggersandsparks.com/blog/going-places-with-typography/">last week's post about design in transit systems</a>, I thought I'd post a little tidbit I came across in Dubrovnik.

I'd just landed in town, ready for a new language, new currency, and new adventures. I'd had about four hours of sleep, stretched out on a bench in the neon-lighted bar of the ferry from Italy to Croatia, and I was wandering about, trying to orient myself, with a backpack the approximate size and weight of a bear strapped to my back. I head toward what looks like it might be a cash machine and I come across this delightful sign:

[caption id="attachment_577" align="alignnone" width="400" caption="Don&#39;t play with guns, alright, kids?"]<a href="http://www.triggersandsparks.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/F1820003.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-577 " title="Bizarre signage in Croatia" src="http://www.triggersandsparks.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/F1820003-500x747.jpg" alt="Bizarre signage in Croatia" width="400" height="598" /></a>[/caption]

Okay, so who designed this logo, and what is HVIDR-a? The handicapped gun club? A grim warning against playing with guns? An aggressive claim to the juicy parking spots? Doesn't being in a wheelchair get you out of conscription?

After a bit of a Google-hunt, turns out it's the <a href="http://www.hvidra-zagreb.hr/">Croatian Disabled Homeland War Veterans Association</a>, which is an awfully long name for a rather serious organization. Civil war is still a fresh wound for countries in the former Yugoslavia&mdash;in Dubrovnik, you can still see where shells hit the walls, and you still can't go off the marked paths in Sarajevo in case you accidentally set off a landmine. (Apparently you can also find <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarajevo_Rose">Sarajevo Roses</a> on the streets, but I didn't actually see any while I was there.)

Given all that, I really do suspect they could do with a slightly more&hellip; tactful logo.
