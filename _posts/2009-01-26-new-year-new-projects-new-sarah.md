I've had the craziest last-little-while: personally, professionally, otherwise. I took my first vacation in years and disappeared into the Mayan jungle for a week, and I've just recently returned from just shy of a full month spent on-the-road, living out of suitcases and backpacks and the trunk of my car. It's been utterly fabulous--exhausting and refreshing simultaneously, and just what I needed to return to my life &amp; business with a clean brain &amp; slate.

I have many stories and photographs, which are forthcoming. For now, two new projects: <a href="http://triggersandsparks.com/project/show/86">the holiday cards I mean to do every year</a>, and <a href="http://triggersandsparks.com/project/show/88">a redesign and rearchitecturing of Fernwood Publishing</a>.
