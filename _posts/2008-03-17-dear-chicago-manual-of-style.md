<a href="http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/">Damn, you look fine.</a>

Where've you been all my life? Or, more accurately, where've you been the last four years of my life, during which I never once worried about properly citing an essay penned by three authors quoting a stage play by an unknown playwright? I mean, the Virgo-perfectionist in me really loves style manuals. And I really need to work on my typographic correctness. I'm a little ashamed to say that I've only VERY recently come to learn about using my proper em-dashes (I'm still a little unclear on en-dashes). Clients who didn't automatically smart-quote their own HTML (read: all of them) for a while were the bane of my existence, until I cajoled a programmer friend into writing me a block of regular expressions that does it automatically. I'm making progress.

Anyway, I know it's been a while, but boy, have you ever kept yourself in shape. What a typographically pretty website.
