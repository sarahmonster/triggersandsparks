<p>I've finally settled into Lunenburg and am in the process of repainting my whole apartment, which is growing in scope exponentially every time I find more paint chips in a hardware store. I've just finished the <a href="http://triggersandsparks.com/index.php?display=51">Idealbikes</a> website, and I'm currently breaking the ice with two new clients, both based in Lunenburg. New website should be coming soon, complete with a better design and more stuff to look at!</p>
