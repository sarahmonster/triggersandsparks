<p>Once more the pre-winter pre-Christmas blues are settling into my bones and turning me into a bed-potato, which is essentially the same thing as a couch potato, except that instead of watching Everybody Loves Raymond six times a day, I curl up with Russian authors. That said, I'm undergoing all kinds of personal growth & discovery, facing truly living on my own for the first time, and hoping to emerge with, like, a bazillion creative exploits. All I need is motivation.


</p><p>For now, I've finished <a href="index.php?display=73">COPAN Offshore</a>'s logo and business card, so those are finally up for display. I've also added some <a href="index.php?display=testimonials">testimonials</a> so that you can hear about how great people think I am. Since things have slowed down at work, I've been re-re-re-re-teaching myself Flash (I've been using it since version 4 and I keep having to re-familiarize myself with it!) by building a little standalone music player, which is almost finished. My next personal project is going to be a simple game -- so if anyone has any clever ideas that DESPERATELY need to be realized, send 'em my way, and I'll see what I can do!</p>
