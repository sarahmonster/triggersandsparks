Have I mentioned how much I love my clients? I checked the mailbox yesterday and found a box full of delicious chocolate muffins (thank goodness customs didn't open the box!), accompanied by this note:
<blockquote>Hi Sarah,

So sorry to hear that you lost a considerable amount of work when water spilled on your computer. While chocolate zucchini muffins (no nuts--in case you're allergic) won't bring the material back (wouldn't that be great), perhaps they can fuel the recreation process. Just want to let you know that we can be patient for an ultimately high-quality product.

Cheers!

How utterly sweet &amp; lovely is that? I am an incredibly lucky girl to get to work with such fabulous clients.
