<p>I realized early this morning when accidentally entering the date wrongly on an estimate that it was T&amp;S&rsquo;s official first birthday yesterday. By sheer luck of the draw, my official date of business registration happened to be 06/06/06. Not that I&rsquo;m a raging Satanist or anything, but the fifteen-year-old-boy who lives inside me thinks that's cool. (I also like the trinity aspect that seems to be sneaking into my business&mdash;my door number is going to be 3, there are three rooms and three doors in my studio&hellip;)</p>

<p>Mind you, numbers confuse me so much sometimes, I needed to edit this post three times to make it factually accurate.</p>

<p>In celebration, I would like everyone to light a firework, sparkler, or a match at some point today. (Because I only just now realized that it is now the 7th, and no longer the 6th, and thus I actually have nothing to celebrate and am probably a bad parent for missing my firstborn&rsquo;s first birthday.) And then go look at <a href="http://hsd.interconnection.org">this website</a>, because I really like it and had a lot of fun trying to make it work.</p>
