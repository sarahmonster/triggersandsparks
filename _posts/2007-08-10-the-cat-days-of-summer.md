<p>Everything seems to be in a bit of a lull. I have so many projects that are <em>almost</em> finished, but need that last little bit of content or that last cycle of feedback. I&rsquo;m told that this is normal for the design industry in the summertime. Regardless, it makes me feel as though I&rsquo;m not being productive, even though that isn&rsquo;t the case in the least. In fact, I seem to be getting a lot of my long-term to-do-items crossed off my list, which is a fantastic feeling!</p>

<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve been talking about it forever, and, <em>finally</em>, it&rsquo;s official&mdash;resumes are on sale! <a href="http://www.triggersandsparks.com/project/show/44">Get all the details here</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m doing a whole host of revisions to my custom client admin panel codebase, so anyone getting one of those with their new website in the upcoming months will be seeing a more elegantly designed and more user-friendly interface there. While I&rsquo;m in there, I&rsquo;ll also be overhauling the code base so that it&rsquo;s cleaner and stabler, meaning better, stronger, faster websites for everyone!</p>

<p>Oh, and there is <em>one</em> new project I can show for the time being: <a href="http://www.triggersandsparks.com/project/show/63">another newspaper ad for the post office space</a>. Coming up soon: an explanation for why I&rsquo;ve been stealing stickers off all the apples in the grocery store, and all sorts more.</p>
