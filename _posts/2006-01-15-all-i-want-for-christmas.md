<p>Just when I was starting to think I was about to have a boring week, everything suddenly got crazy. First, this local Halifax band (name to be finalized soon!) contacted me about doing a website, which means I get to get put on the guest list for their shows and sit around drinking Caesars and yelling about font sizes while my ears start ringing. Then, my local Liberal MP candidate contacted me about doing HIS website, and he needed it ready to go in under two weeks. Then my car needed four hours of repairs -- and I was all set to drive 15 hours to Ottawa in a week and a bit. My Christmas shopping ended up primarily involving a massive quantity of Hershey's Kisses and a trip to the liquor store, but I pulled everything off and managed the trip in one long, steady go with my cat on my lap the entire ride, while the South Shore Liberals kept warm at home with their new website: <a href="http://triggersandsparks.com/index.php?display=75">votedarian.ca</a>.</p>
