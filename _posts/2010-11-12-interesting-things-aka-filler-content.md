    filler content
---
After <a href="http://triggersandsparks.com/blog/what-ive-learned-from-broken-bones-and-painkillers/">spending three months in a cast earlier this year</a>, I have managed to successfully break my <em>other</em> wrist now. (Apparently my bones are made of eggshell.) I'm still in the early stages, so typing is a challenge, and I've had all kinds of emails and business to attend to. Accordingly, I'm taking the easy way out this week, and sharing some interesting, mostly design-related, items from my <a title="Follow me!" href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/london.semark">Google Reader</a>.
<h2>Pretty and/or interesting things</h2>
<a href="http://lovelypackage.com/jewel-house-collection/">Jewel House Collection</a>: Gorgeous pattern, and it resonates nicely with my new infatuation with English royals around the time when they liked chopping heads off willy-nilly.

<a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ForgetTheFilmWatchTheTitles/~3/KhIBlNthurc/00192-Nanny_McPhee_and_the_Big_Bang">Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang</a>: The font's a bit overused and inelegant, but the titles are otherwise rather charming and lovely.

<a href="http://www.mademan.com/how-bribe-police-foreign-countries">How to Bribe Police in Foreign Countries</a>:&nbsp;Something I've always been curious about, and will almost invariably at some point need to know.
