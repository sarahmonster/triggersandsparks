Because I'm sure that those of you who know me well don't hear enough of my thoughts on design. This is a questionnaire I filled out in response to a freelance job posting. It was quite an exhaustive process, actually, and I only had a short timeframe in which to complete it, but I gave it my best shot. (I've edited out the "technical" portion and the examples &amp; attachments, as that sounded a little too much like a high school test for even me to be interested in it!)<!--more-->


<h2>Process</h2>
<h3>1.Do you start with a rough comp or go straight into a "finished" design?</h3>
Usually when working for clients I'll start with four different initial rough mockups. We then revise back and forth, and with each stage of revision I start pulling the pieces together into a more polished final, along with applying the client's suggestions.
<h3>1a. Do you mock up on paper or in photoshop?</h3>
A little bit of both, usually ... though I usually don't show the paper mockups to anyone!
<h3>2. How much time do you usually spend creating a home page design?</h3>
This tends to vary depending on the client and their budget. Most of my clients are small-budget so I keep things as quick as possible without sacrificing aesthetics too much. Usually, to take a design from mockups through to completed template (before any coding happens!) takes around 10 hours, including all the stages of revision.
<h3>3. How much time do you typically spend "polishing" a design?</h3>
I have been known to spend tens of hours, but generally, as I do try to keep an eye on the clock and not indulge my perfectionist side too much, it tends to average out at about 5-10 hours, depending of course on the complexity of the design!
<h3>4. Would you say you are more "get it done, get it out" focused or "get it perfect" focused?</h3>
I think I'm naturally more the latter ... if I'm designing something for myself or for a client who doesn't have time restrictions, I can spend a good deal of time poring over the minute details. But most of my clients want it done now, and don't have a lot of money to spend indulging me, so I do quite effectively steer myself towards the “get it done” line of focus.
<h3>5. How do you manage design quality vs. time available?</h3>
I try to make it so that my process facilitates better quality, and obviously, as I get better, I find that I'm able to do better work in less time, and spend less time on work that goes nowhere. I try to really restrict the amount of time I put into rough comps, as a lot of this can be “wasted” time. I've got to the point where I can do comps far more quickly, and am then left with more time near to the end of a project to refine and polish. I also try to make myself focus on the things that people will actually notice, rather than the things that only matter to me, and this keeps my perspective in line a bit.
<h2>Style</h2>
<h3>1. How would you describe your artistic style?</h3>
I do tend to vary—one of the things I love about design is that you don't really need to pigeonhole yourself into one aesthetic, as different projects require different styles. However, I find my style usually tends toward being rather clean &amp; simple, with bold lines and colour. I like to offset this with the use of textures and typographic flourishes, so that things aren't quite so stark.
<h3>2. Who would you say has influenced your design style?</h3>
That's another thing that I love about design! Influences come from everywhere ... I can be as inspired by a bottle of juice as I can be by a stunning website. I find my style is most influenced by beautiful things that I find around me—good recent examples of this are this gorgeous PaperBlanks day planner I bought, a book called “The Modern Gentleman”, and the shape of the tree outside my window.
<h3>3. What do you think should drive the visual style of a website?</h3>
The most important thing is that it reflects the message of its content, and is in line with its company's marketing objectives. That comes first—some sites require a textured, elaborate look, while others demand something simpler or more professional-looking. I always try to ensure I have a good idea of what the design should be “saying” prior to even thinking about a design. Design can communicate so much before anyone reads even so much as a word on the page; it's vital that your first impression be the right one!
<h3>4. What are some examples of sites (not yours) that you like?</h3>
butterlondon.com, alistapart.com, chicagomanualofstyle.org, giohalifax.com, walnutgrovespring.com, marketcircle.com, 37signals.com, klf.org, webdesignerwall.com
<h3>5. What are some examples of sites that you dislike?</h3>
MySpace! about.com ... there are so many, it's really hard to just name a few!
Misc
<h3>1. To what extent were you taught/receive formal training on design vs. learning by yourself?</h3>
I actually learned web design, and, by extension, the basics of PS, when I was about fourteen, so I'd been doing it relying on a “good eye” for some time before I went to school.  School gave me a decent understanding of the basics and of how to apply them, but I found that I've learned much more since being out of school! I read a lot: websites, magazines, books, and I'm always trying to learn new things. I feel constantly like a student.
<h3>2. What design websites do you read regularly?</h3>
A List Apart, Vitamin, Veer, design.Principles, Be a Design Group (since defunct), Graphic Define, FreelanceSwitch, The Book Design Review.
<h3>3. What is your a recent blog post or article on design you enjoyed?</h3>
There was a fantastic article in the last issue of Design Edge magazine about book cover design that I really enjoyed, and another one about this redesign of a honey manufacturer's marketing materials. (I tend to enjoy reading magazines more than I do websites! I spend too much time staring into the screen.) I recently really enjoyed this <a href="http://www.typography.com/ask/showBlog.php?blogID=98">History of the Ampersand</a>.
<h3>4.What are your top three "must read" books on design?</h3>
Stop Stealing Sheep, The Elements of Typographic Style, Universal Principles of Design.
<h3>5. What are the latest trends in web design?</h3>
Gradients, things reflected in invisible mirrors (this usually is done without any logical consideration), that curly/flourishy vector look, extra whitespace to create a long long scrolling page, use of large icons and directing graphics, increased simplicity, grunge elements seem to be back again, but in more of a texture/background sort of a way...
