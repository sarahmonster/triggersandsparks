<p>So here&rsquo;s the thing. I realize in advance that I&rsquo;m going to come off as a crazy cat lady here. I&rsquo;ll admit I&rsquo;ve always been a little nervous about the crazy-cat-lady thing. People tell me that three cats is enough to make you a CCL, and given my penchant for losing my beloved familiars, I&rsquo;ve always managed to stay far away from that line.</p>

<p>Of course, I forgot to spay my kitten, and she hit puberty one day when I wasn't home. Suddenly she was weighing about ninety pounds and her belly was the size of a football. Bob Barker would have my head.</p>

<p>So Kalliope is a young, unwed mother. She gave birth to three kittens on September 28th. She was considerate enough to choose <em>my bed</em> as her birthing room, so I came home to find three tiny closed-eyed little rodenty creatures in a pile on my duvet, a bloody mess on my pillow, and a stillborn under my sheet. I did a <em>lot</em> of laundry.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always been infatuated with creation. Given the option, I&rsquo;d almost always rather create than consume, which is why I tend to gravitate towards writing, drawing, painting, Lego sets, etc. Watching another life be created, though? That puts everything else to shame. I suppose this is the sort of thing people usually realize when they have children, but, well, I&rsquo;m too much of a child myself to ever go that route.</p>

<p>While I&rsquo;ve been feeling unproductive because most of my projects are stalled in some midphase, or they're behind-the-scenes sorts of pieces that I can&rsquo;t really add to my portfolio, Kallie&rsquo;s been raising three beautiful, healthy, and only marginally psychotic tiger-striped felines.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m trying hard not to get attached, but I&rsquo;ve watched them quadruple in size. I was there when their eyes started to open, I knew them when their ears were closed flat, and I taught them to eat solid food. Two weeks ago, they all had earned names.</p>

<p>This is Copernicus at about three weeks old:</p>

<p>Oh, and in actual news, I&rsquo;ve added two new projects&mdash;<a href="http://triggersandsparks.com/project/show/64">digitaledge.ca</a> and <a href="http://triggersandsparks.com/project/show/65">a logo for Comfort &amp; Joy</a> (website in production!). But, really, neither of those attack my shoes when I walk into the room, so they really just seem less thrilling, somehow.</p>
