I really enjoyed <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/museumofmodernfiction/sets/72157604997611884/show/">this little storybook</a>. Something about childish/60's-esque illustration (especially when paired with more adult subject matter) really appeals to me. I like that the illustrator managed to use a techy "cold" object like a MacBook and still have it work with the more textured &amp; natural style (the screen static was an especially nice touch).
