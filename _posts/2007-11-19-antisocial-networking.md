<p>For someone who spends such an extensive amount of her day online, I ignored the &ldquo;Social Networking Revolution&rdquo; for a surprisingly long time, mostly for the same reasons that I never owned a television&mdash;I tend to be a little wary of things that suck up time without creating anything tangible.</p>

<p>Oh, and I'm not particularly social as it is. And networking? I'm starting to think I&rsquo;m biologically incapable of doing it.</p>

<p>But hey, I own a television now. I'm no less productive (probably because it&rsquo;s off almost all the time) than I was before. So the social networking thing? I could bite the bullet.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been making use of both <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=684335203">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/triggersandsparks">LinkedIn</a> for a while now. I recently broke down and got on <a href="http://www.myspace.com/triggersandsparks">MySpace</a>, which gives me headaches to look at, but lets me keep a list of bands I should check out on hand. I've been starting to take a look at Facebook&rsquo;s developer tools&mdash;I'm interested in the prospect of being able to integrate the sites I build with such a widely-used site. And, as I was doing it, I came across Facebook Pages, a new feature that allows you to list your business. Neat!</p>

<p>In short: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=6632880052">Triggers & Sparks is now on Facebook.</a></p>

<p>As everyone who knows me is aware, I am a complete feedback junky. I'm hoping that this will give me a venue to present some works-in-progress and get some other opinions&hellip;sort of like a focus group for designs, which is something I could really use.</p>

<p>Interested? Well, of course you are! Feel free to become a "fan" (the egomaniac in me likes that term) and shower me with thoughts, ideas, and opinions. Harsh criticism always welcomed&mdash;I like the idea of making design a more interactive sport. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=6632880052">Get involved here!</a></p>

<p>Oh, and if you&rsquo;re more interested in completed projects, I&rsquo;ve added another <a href="http://triggersandsparks.com/project/show/66">logo redesign</a> to my portfolio.</p>
