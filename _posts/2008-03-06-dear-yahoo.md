<a href="http://education.yahoo.net/degrees/articles/featured_8_careers_to_help_lower_your_stress_meter.html">My job is not stress-free!</a>

I am pretty much a constant bundle of stress. And while I realize your article is more of an advertorial than anything, I still have to disagree.<!--more-->

Sure, the job satisfaction is pretty high, when you've got a client that works <em>with</em> you, and not <em>against</em> you. When everyone pays their bills on time.Â  When great projects just land in your lap. When your computer <em>doesn't</em> break down right before a deadline. When nobody asks you to take a perfectly lovely design, and add something totally horrendous to it. When you aren't being micromanaged, told your work is no good, or harassed by constant telephone calls asking why <em>insert project name here</em> isn't finished yet. In short, when pigs fly over frozen hellfire.

I mean, don't get me wrong. I love my job, and I wouldn't trade it for anything, and for every lousy client I have three fantastic clients. But stress-free? <strong>Hah!</strong>
