<p>&hellip;for a girl goes on and on about how &ldquo;you should make sure to update your website on a regular basis, or else!&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m pretty terrible at doing it myself. I&rsquo;ve been trying to get into the blogging thing, but I&rsquo;m having trouble motivating myself to post at least once a week! For shame.</p><!--more-->

<p>I&rsquo;m going to say that it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve been so busy working on other people&rsquo;s websites:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.triggersandsparks.com/project/show/70">a website proper for Black Ships</a></li>

<li><a href="http://www.triggersandsparks.com/project/show/76">a revamp of Atlantic Sojourn B&amp;B</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.triggersandsparks.com/project/show/75">a logo for Website Maintenance and Design</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.triggersandsparks.com/project/show/77">a dog food bag design</a></li>

<li><a href="http://www.triggersandsparks.com/project/show/78">organizational charts for the Canadian Transportation Agency</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I think I need to start paying myself to work on my own website.</p>
