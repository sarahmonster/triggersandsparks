When I was working on my new design for this website, I spent a lot of time evaluating my options for image display, as it's one of the most vital elements of the site. I had very specific requirements for what I wanted, both in terms of the look &amp; feel of the galleries, and the ease of implementation. I spent forever looking through all sorts of Wordpress plugins, hacks, and standalone solutions, and eventually settled (grudgingly) on a Flash-based option: <a href="http://wp-simpleviewer.fuggi82.de/">WP-Simpleviewer</a>, based on the <a href="http://www.simpleviewer.net/simpleviewer/">SimpleViewer </a>plugin.

Of course, after spending forever (I stopped counting somewhere along the line) spent making it work precisely (and pixel-perfectly) to my liking, it's now <em>broken</em>. <strong>Every single image in my portfolio is now displaying with jagged images.</strong> Cue panic! It was <em>fine</em> last time I checked! What on <em>earth</em> happened? I still have no idea, and I hate to think how long it may have been broken before I noticed. (Note to self: keep an eye on these things, alright? Sheesh. My contact form plugin had also deactivated itself without my noticing somewhere along the line. <em>Not</em> good.)

So I'm ditching the SimpleViewer. (I am guessing that much of my weekend will be spent tweaking and implementing the change, so things are going to look terrible between now and then.) I found an alternative that I think will be better, and simpler in the long run, although of course it does mean that I need to go through every portfolio post and upload new galleries: <a href="http://www.bin-co.com/blog/2009/07/gallifrey-image-gallery-wordpress-plugin/">Gallifrey</a>, based on <a href="http://www.twospy.com/galleriffic/">Galleriffic</a>. (If you're nerd-chic and/or British enough, you'll recognize this as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who">The Doctor</a>'s home planet, which rather delights me as I've just started falling in love with all things Tardis-related.) It works with Wordpress' built-in gallery functions, is super-customizable, and will even finally allow me to implement my triple-bordered image display that I wanted initially for this site. Simpleviewer, you were fantastic, but it's time for us to part ways.

Can Flash go into the ground already? There was a time when it was useful for websites, but with jQuery and a myriad of other frameworks as well-developed as they are, there really is very little excuse for it anymore. There are all sorts of <a href="http://www.designinginteractive.com/design/why-flash-is-mostly-bad/">reasons</a> <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20001029.html">why Flash is bad</a>: it's horrible for search engine optimization, it mucks with usability, it's often slow to load, it refuses to display on an iPhone, and it won't print or display itself in a feed reader (at least, best I can tell). While the number of websites relying on Flash has decreased dramatically in the past few years, it's still a little too prevalent. No more Flash, okay? There's always an alternative.

Sometimes you just need to screw up enough to find it.
