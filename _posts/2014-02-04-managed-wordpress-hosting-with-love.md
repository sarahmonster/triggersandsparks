Shared hosting <strong>sucks</strong>. I know; I've been using it for years. I've used almost every major cheap shared host at some point or another. For nearly ten years, I hosted my own sites, and some of my clients', with a very popular and well-known provider of shared hosting. Even with all the speed bottlenecks, sludgy response times, restricted access, and security holes; shared hosting was cheap, easy to use, and the positives outweighed the negatives. Until last year, I had no problems.

Then everything fell apart.

Completely out of the blue, all my sites slowed to an absolute crawl. Most of the time they wouldn't load at all, but when they did, it took several minutes. I had clients emailing me, rightfully angry and worried, and I couldn't do a thing about it. My hosting company's customer service dropped the ball, telling me that it was a server problem and they were looking into it, but with no estimation of when the issue would be solved. I didn't have enough control to do anything to fix what ended up being a server configuration problem.

This went on for <em>days</em>.

And it wasn't the first time. I'd had sites that were hacked. I'd had days where my sites weren't working, for reasons beyond my control. I spent a lot of time talking to customer support and getting frustrated. This wasn't the only time I'd had a bad experience with shared hosting, but it was the one that made me realize it was time to do something different.

By the time the whole experience was finally over, my sites had been completely inaccessible for over a week. I needed a month-long vacation somewhere <em>very</em> warm (with <em>very</em> plentiful mojitos) to recover from all the stress I'd been under, and my clients weren't happy. 

<p class="cap">So I decided to do something about it. I moved my own site to a private VPS and, with the help of my nerdy programmer boyfriend, started learning to take care of it myself. It was certainly a steep learning curve. Server administration isn't a skill designers often possess, and it's a lot trickier than I would have expected.</p>

But after a few months of tweaking and configuring and sleeping next to my phone (set to go crazy if the server went down for even one second) I finally figured it out. Now the server is rock-solid: it's fast, it's stable, it's secure. I've been hosting this site and a few clients on it, and for the past six months it hasn't had a single issue. It's everything <em>I</em> could want in a web-server, and now I'm ready to share it with you.

I'm offering a <strong>comprehensive managed WordPress hosting package</strong> for your website: hosting with a little extra. (Tailored for WordPress sites, because that's 90% of the sites I build, and because the server has been specially configured to host them.) Interested? Here are the details.

<h2>Managed Updates</h2>
Basically, I'll be taking care of your site for you. This means I'll be making sure WordPress and its plugins are updated on a regular basis, and checking your site to ensure nothing's broken. I'll also take care of minor updates—within reason—so if you need an email address changed or a new page added and can't figure out how to do it yourself: I've got you covered.
<h2>Super-resilient Backups</h2>
Most of the time WordPress site are pretty safe, but databases can become corrupted thanks to obscure bugs or strange plugins—meaning that all your posts, pages, and settings can vanish. I can't tell you the number of times I've needed to piece together a corrupted site from an old or half-done backup file. To combat this, I have <strong>two</strong> backup solutions in place for every site on my server (yes, your backups have backups). Backups are saved offsite for extra-resilience, and I can even send them to your email, Dropbox, or an FTP account of your choosing, so you can have as much or as little control as you'd like. You'll also be able to download backups from your admin panel at any time. 
<h2>Resilient Security</h2>
Being hacked is pretty insane. When I was living in Spain, my aforementioned shared hosting server (and thus my sites) were attacked by hackers frequently—and of course the internet would keep going haywire just when I discovered them. I've learned a <em>lot</em> from those experiences. In addition to using rather strict security settings for the server itself, I've configured an advanced WordPress plugin to prevent common hack attempts. I currently have six different sites, plus my own, hosted on my server, and I've managed to proactively thwart every attempted hacker.
<h2>Blazing fast page load times</h2>
The server is already optimized for super-speedy WordPress performance, and I'll configure caching to boost its performance even further. Technically speaking, caching is so aggressive that your site will work even in the (very unlikely) case that PHP or MySQL is down, meaning that your site will be able to boast both an extremely fast server response time (faster than 95% of websites last time I tested) and a bulletproof uptime (100% uptime in the last month, 99.97% in the last six months).

<h2>Sounds great! How do I sign up?</h2>
I've been slowly signing up select clients over the past year, and now I'm ready to open it up to the public. I'm currently pricing this hosting program at $40 per month and will be accepting a limited number of new clients.
