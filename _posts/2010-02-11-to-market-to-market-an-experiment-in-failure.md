This year has marked my first venture into "selling stuff", instead of just "selling myself". It's been a little hit-and-miss: my <a href="http://www.triggersandsparks.com/portfolio/snarky-macabre-valentines/">Valentines</a> seemed popular (they were listed on <a href="http://ooh-shiny.net/?p=9100">Ooh! Shiny!</a> and in the <a href="http://www.etsy.com/storque/spotlight/anti-valentines-day-7023/">Etsy blog</a>, and I've heard loads of positive feedback), which was immensely exciting, but they didn't sell like mad. (They didn't really even sell like slightly-unusual.)

<strong>First lesson learned: just because you make something that people like, doesn't mean that people will actually buy it. </strong>

This weekend, at a friend's suggestion, I booked a booth at a local farmer's market. For only $60, it seemed like a wildly clever business idea. How could I possibly NOT make a fortune?

Well, not only did I not make a fortune, but I actually didn't sell <em>a single card</em>, unless you count the one that I traded a bookseller for a tattered copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Slang-Sin-Lighter-Side-Language/dp/0877796270">The Slang of Sin</a>. There were quite a few people who came by and told me how much they liked them, and one person even asked how much they cost (they <em>were </em>next to a sign that listed prices, but that seems irrelevant).

Midway through day two of sitting behind a booth, bored to tears and trying desperately not to leap on everyone who walked past, I realized that nobody would ever buy one. What was I doing wrong?

<strong>Second lesson learned: research your market. </strong>

Of course, I didn't think to look around me, but once I did, I realized what I had done wrong--I'd come to the wrong place entirely. It wasn't even so much that people weren't buying from <em>me</em>, as it was that they weren't buying from <em>anyone</em>. I'm still not quite sure how anyone at that market sells enough to make a profit, but perhaps they did better in other parts. The busy bits seemed to be the "food court" and the flea market tables.

Had I done my research and actually visited this market prior to committing an entire weekend to it, I may have had a little more luck with it.

<strong>Third lesson learned: bring a book. </strong>

I forgot how boring it can be sitting around waiting for customers that never appear.

<strong>Fourth lesson learned: Don't take it personally. </strong>

It was midway through that second day that I started really doubting myself. Four hours seemed like forever away, and, while I knew that I wouldn't be selling anything that day, I was determined to stick it out 'til the better end. Prior to that point, my abysmal failure hadn't gotten me down. I kept having to remind myself that the whole affair was an experiment, and that it's okay to fail. (Not that I plan on making a habit of it.)

<strong>Fifth lesson learned: stores will sell your things FOR you if you just ask nicely. </strong>

Thanks, <a href="http://www.dulynoted.ca/">Duly Noted</a> and <a href="http://lovemeboutique.wordpress.com/">Love, Me</a>! Not only is it <em>totally</em> exciting to think that things I made are in a real-live shop, now I get to stay home and make more!
