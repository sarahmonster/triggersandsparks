After all the hectic-ness and flurry of activity that was the big website launch, I took <em>a whole day off</em> for the first time in ages. I curled up with a blanket and read a good hundred or so pages of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Master_and_Margarita">The Master and Margarita</a> (which I highly recommend), then went out to a Christmas party dressed as, depending on how you see it, either a very large, very talkative present, or a Vegas waitress on Christmas.

I felt so refreshed the next day that I very nearly made it a whole weekend off work! After all, what are Sundays for if not catnaps and hot baths, and general relaxation? However, my photographically-inclined roommate was applying for a job, and her tumblr website was doing a terrible job of showcasing her skills.

So we sat down together, spent about half an hour combing through photographs of trees, and eventually pulled together this quick-and-dirty little website for her. It's using the same image-display script I use for my own site, and there are still a few kinks I'll need to work out, but it's a good example of what can be pulled together in an evening if you're motivated enough.

Do check out <a href="http://laurenm.triggersandsparks.com">her website</a>—she does some lovely work, and she's looking to do more!
