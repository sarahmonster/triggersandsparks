<p>So business is good, I think. It's still too early to tell, and there's so much going on that I'm trying to stay on top of. Quickbooks, in particular, is eating up my time like some sort of monster. I used to think I <em>liked</em> numbers, but I think it's time we broke up.</p>

<p>Lots of new work in the pipeline, along with some old projects that are being wrapped up. I finished a logo and <a href="http://liberalleadership2007.com">website</a> for the Nova Scotia Liberal Party Leadership (rather a mouthful) and am maintaining it as the campaign progresses. A few new things should be cropping up soon, but I'm going to set precedence by staying quiet about them until they're finished.</p>

<p>Going from a part-time to a full-time business is as much of a challenge as I expected, but I'm getting lots of support from people, and I'm learning as I go. And being able to work at 4am, and take a noontime nap? Yeah, it's nice.</p>
