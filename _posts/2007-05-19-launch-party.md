<p>My business has so many birthdays, it's ridiculous. At any rate, my official "holy cow how long can you put that thing off, sarah?" launch party begins tonight at seven. 118 Lincoln Street (Lunenburg), and everyone's welcome. There will be goody bags and maybe a door prize and some wine and cheese, plus good design-y talk with a sleep-deprived over-stressed sarah. There may or may not be fireworks.</p>
