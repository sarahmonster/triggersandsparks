I usually use <a href="http://script.aculo.us/">Scriptalicious</a> for my AJAX needs, but I'm working on a set of AJAX-ified forms on a website that's already using <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, so I figure hey, it can't be that hard to change over! Twenty minutes later, cue the loud cursing and growling. I mean, the whole thing seems <strong>far</strong> more powerful, but every time I've wanted to start implementing it, I've been turned off by how complex it seems to do simple things. (Like slide down a div window, which I hope to have accomplished before I turn 30. On a side note, I've been feeling old because I turned 25 today, until my little sister sent me a message saying that I'm "plenty young, for a president!" Which I suppose is technically true, so I don't feel quite so washed up anymore.)

Anyway, back to my jQuery-induced headache: <a href="http://www.webdesignerwall.com/tutorials/jquery-tutorials-for-designers/">this very helpful thing to the rescue</a>! If I can stop being distracted by the gorgeous site design, I might be able to figure this stuff out, after all, without having to spend all day teaching my brain new methods of programming. I do so love programming tutorials written for designers. Thank you, pretty colourful website!
