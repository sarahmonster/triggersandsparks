<p>I think I&rsquo;m finally starting to see how everything balances out. I spent a ridiculous amount of effort getting everything ready for my launch party, and ended up accidentally locking myself out of my studio at 7am in the pouring rain. I had one nasty cold, but everyone who came to the launch (and there weren&rsquo;t many, given that I&rsquo;m a moron and set it in the middle of a long weekend) came in the door with a bottle of wine and I ended my night happy, blissful, and with a studio that actually <em>looks</em> like a studio now, and is full of colour and art and all those other things I like so much. On the other hand, the internet&rsquo;s out, so I can&rsquo;t seem to actually make <em>use</em> of it.</p>

<p>This morning I took my beloved Etta (my Civic) in for her MVI and was told she&rsquo;s no good anymore, and it&rsquo;s time to buy a new car. But this afternoon? I officially got my LGDC, which means I am now a professional portfolio-reviewed member of the Society of Graphic Designers of Canada. Time for another party!</p>

<p>And in other news, I think I am becoming a better designer. Lots and lots of projects are in the making, and I can&rsquo;t wait to show them off.</p>
