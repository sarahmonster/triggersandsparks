<p>It seems like it&rsquo;s been forever since I actually added new pieces to my portfolio&mdash;as it is, it&rsquo;s getting overstuffed. (See the website thumbnail pull-down. Must fix that.) Leaving it all to do in bulk like this makes it a bit of a painful process.</p>

<p>So, in answer to the burning &ldquo;so what exactly <em>have</em> you been doing all this time, Sarah?&rdquo; question, I have the following: <a href="http://triggersandsparks.com/project/show/55">a logo for Bill Smith</a>, <a href="http://triggersandsparks.com/project/show/58">novascotialobstercouncil.com</a>,  <a href="http://triggersandsparks.com/project/show/59">atlanticgatewayalliance.com</a>,  <a href="http://triggersandsparks.com/project/show/60">lunenburgframing.ca</a>, <a href="http://triggersandsparks.com/project/show/61">an online quilt store</a>,  <a href="http://triggersandsparks.com/project/show/62">a volunteer project for a Senegalese non-profit</a>,  <a href="http://triggersandsparks.com/project/show/56">a business card and a brochure for Smuggler&rsquo;s Cove Inn</a>, and, just in case you&rsquo;re interested, <a href="http://triggersandsparks.com/project/show/57">a look at my own branding efforts</a>. As usual, there&rsquo;s a boatload of other stuff in the works.</p>
