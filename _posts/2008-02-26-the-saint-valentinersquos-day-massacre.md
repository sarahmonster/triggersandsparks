<p>I have a total love-hate relationship with Valentine&rsquo;s Day. (Yes, I know this comes a little late, but I&rsquo;m about a week behind on everything else right now, so it seems somehow fitting.) Yes, it&rsquo;s trite and silly and you should be nice to the people you love all year long, and not just when you&rsquo;re obligated to. Honestly though, I know I sometimes need a little extra push. And the girly side of me is always disappointed when I don&rsquo;t get flowers (I&rsquo;ve had a lengthy string of boyfriends who&rsquo;ve committed this sin, thinking that I&rsquo;d dislike being given them. Seriously, who dislikes being given flowers?)</p>

 <p>At any rate, every year, I have the best intentions to lovingly handcraft gorgeous cards for everyone, and every year, I never get around to doing it. (I guess at least I have my traditions, even if they involve disappointing myself!) This year heralded a near-success, as I threw together a card at the eleventh hour (literally, it was eleven o&rsquo;clock):</p>

<p>Aren&rsquo;t I adorable?</p>

 <p>It&rsquo;s amazing how good it felt to spend just ten minutes drawing for fun again. Ten minutes! You&rsquo;d think I could get into this habit, no?</p>
 <p>On a side note, I&rsquo;ve been insanely busy. Added two new projects: a <a href="http://www.triggersandsparks.com/project/show/74">logo</a> and a <a href="http://www.triggersandsparks.com/project/show/73">website</a>. </p>
