It's only taken me about half a year, but I've finally crossed an item off my perennially growing “to-do” list: add flash to portfolio. I've always been fond of this <a href="index.php?display=72">monologue</a> from Fear &amp; Loathing, and not solely because it seems like a shopping list for debauchery. While I was at it, I added a <a href="http://triggersandsparks.com/project/show/21">t&amp;s time capsule</a> chronicling some of the various different designs this site has undergone (that's another strikeout on my to-do list). And then for good measure (I was on a roll at this point), I added screenshots of the Brambles Antiques website—both the <a href="http://triggersandsparks.com/project/show/7">public site</a> and the <a href="index.php?display=71">admin panel</a>. These days, I'm working with COPAN Offshore to develop a logo for their new business, and am painting my bedroom walls a bright gold.
