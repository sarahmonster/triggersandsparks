<p>So I&rsquo;ve moved yet <em>again</em> and am just getting back on my feet. For anyone who may be interested in sending me lovely things in the mail, my new address is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
TRIGGERS & SPARKS GRAPHIC DESIGNS<br />
   6987 Vaughan Avenue, Halifax NS <br />
B3L 2M2

<p>I&rsquo;ve also started using a blog, despite my own protests. It's still a bit of a mess, but you can read it to <a href="http://kiss.triggersandsparks.com">get a better idea of what I&rsquo;m up to on a more regular basis</a>. <em>Fun!</em> Eventually I&rsquo;ll integrate it into this site, probably replacing this news section.</p>

<p>I spent the last few days up at the <a href="http://aimconference.com">AIM Conference</a> in Moncton, where I got to meet a lot of new people and learn all sorts of new tricks. I have a whole laundry list of overhauls and additions that I need to make to this site, which it&rsquo;s quite sorely in need of! (Clients do come first, of course.) I learned a lot about search engine optimization and marketing in particular, which I&rsquo;m going to be able to put to good use on some upcoming projects.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re concerned about your ranking in search engines, I&rsquo;m now much better equipped to help you out with it&mdash;though if you&rsquo;re looking for something more in-depth, I&rsquo;d still recommend looking into a professional SEO company like <a href="http://www.alphasearch.ca/">AlphaSearch</a>, who put the conference together.</p>
