<p>It&rsquo;s been officially a year today. A year of no paycheques, no health benefits, no vacation time. No nine a.m. starts, no staying indoors all day staring at a computer screen, no monstrous amounts of unpaid overtime. (Okay, I lied, all of those things have happened, and worse.) I love that I can say that I&rsquo;ve been running my own business for a year and I&rsquo;m still in love with it.</p>

 <p>I&rsquo;ve had the chance to work with a huge range of companies and people over the past year, producing a range of different projects. I&rsquo;ve done newspaper ads, illustrations, resumes, and a whole slew of websites, logos, business cards, and brochures. I&rsquo;ve learned how to use Quickbooks, I&rsquo;ve streamlined my processes, I&rsquo;ve learned some AJAX techniques, I&rsquo;ve rewritten my CMS code base, I&rsquo;ve read about grids and typography and golden ratios. I&rsquo;ve lost out on contracts, and I&rsquo;ve taken on projects that thrilled and challenged me. I make an awful lot less money now than I used to, and I probably work harder. But it&rsquo;s just so much fun. </p>
 <p>However, my one-year-mark is a time for serious consideration. What&rsquo;s my goal here? Where am I going? How is my little business going to grow up? And, most importantly, how can I keep doing what I love, stay sane, and make enough money to keep me in chocolate and red wine for the rest of my life?</p>

 <p>I am coming to realize that:</p>
 <ol>
   <li>Delegate, delegate, delegate. I am a creature of many talents, but I am <em>not</em> any of the following: Salesman. Accountant. Programmer. Mechanic. Stop thinking you can do everything, and start spending more of your time doing what you are good at and do enjoy. </li>

   <li>Nothing comes quickly. Projects will take longer than you expected to reach completion. A two-minute fix will turn into a two-hour session of slamming your head against the wall. Sometimes you&rsquo;ll put an inordinate amount of time into researching an estimate for a project you&rsquo;re not awarded, only to be handed a bigger and better project a year down the line. A lot of what I do is investment. </li>
   <li>It is great to be a workaholic, but make sure you get at least three seconds of fresh air every day. </li>
   <li>Stop taking things so personally. Not everyone can think you&rsquo;re the next coming, and some days, you will just suck. This does not necessarily mean that you are a total failure in all areas of your life, and it is <em>certainly</em> not cause for a mental breakdown. </li>

   <li>Nancy Reagan was right, sort of. Sometimes, you should &ldquo;just say no&rdquo;. As a small-business owner, it&rsquo;s easy to fall into the trap of jumping at anything that dangles a cheque in front of you, but that&rsquo;s not really why you&rsquo;re in this business, anyway, and it&rsquo;s certainly not the most important factor to consider. </li>
 </ol>
 <p>These are my monsters. I'm hoping that, by this time next year, I'll have massacred at least half of them.</p>
