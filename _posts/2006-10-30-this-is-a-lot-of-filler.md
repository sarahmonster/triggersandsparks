<p>Thanks to combined incompetence at Apple and at my "local" (see: an hours' drive away, only open when I'm working) Apple retailer, I haven't had a computer all month, which has seriously curtailed my design activities outside of the gaming industry. I've got a few projects on hold and a few nearing completion -- expect updates soon.

</p><p>For now, a listing of my favourite Google search terms that have brought people to this website:
<ul>
<li>"why don't humans hibernate"</li>
<li>what website can i go to to make a layout of my bedroom then print what my bedroom would look like?</li>
<li>jennifer arnold display and design</li>

<li>grunt labourer services</li>
<li>hrm unorthodox</li>
<li>"sarah pretty"</li>
</ul>
Thanks for the compliment, Google! I think <em>you're</em> pretty, too!
