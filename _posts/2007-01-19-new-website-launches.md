<p>I've been working on this redesign for a <em>long</em> time. It's actually been redesigned three times, and of course it isn't 100% ready to launch, but I'm quite sure it never will be, and it was about time I updated my stagnating website.</p>

<p>Lots of stuff is new. Everything's been restructured and rebuilt using Ruby on Rails. There's a <a href="/resources/list">resources</a> section that's pretty wiki-like up. There are RSS feeds of the news and the projects. There's more content everywhere. And reason why I've been so quiet the last little while?</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/project/show/11">folkharbour.com</a></li>

<li><a href="/project/show/10">bluenosedining.com</a></li>
<li><a href="/project/show/22">nsyl.ca</a></li>

<li><a href="/project/show/28">the BusStop</a></li>

<li><a href="/project/show/23">Inside-Out Cleaning Services</a></li>
<li><a href="/project/show/47">the Switch</a></li>
<li><a href="/project/show/24">Traveller's Joy</a></li>

<li><a href="/project/show/8">Ninja Monkey Knits</a></li>
<li><a href="/project/show/48">Newspaper Ad</a></li>

</ul>

<p>...plus a tonsillectomy, and computer woes like you wouldn't believe, and learning a new programming language. </p>

<p>Say hello to Marigold, who'll be working with me from now on. Marigold will be taking over some project management duties so that I can become more of a hermit.</p>

<p>Say goodbye to Dinah, who disappeared in November and probably isn't coming back.</p>

<p>New projects are in the pipeline, and I have officially quit my job in order to go freelance full-time. Need some work done? Now's a great time to ask, while I'm still a little paranoid about that whole not-getting-a-paycheque thing.</p>

<p>I'm excited. Everything is new and I am learning things at such an exponential rate. It's going to be one hell of a ride.</p>
