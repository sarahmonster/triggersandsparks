Oh, come on, everyone Googles themself at some point, don't they? I do it mostly to see what (if anything) the internet has to say about me, and if any of it will come back to haunt me. I have, at times, been known to disclose too much online.

A Google search for "sarah semark" yields <a href="http://www.southshorenow.ca/archives/viewer.php?sctn=2007/031407/news&amp;article=33">this hilariously erroneous newspaper article from last year</a>, in which my cat is actually referenced as a business partner, and <a href="http://redredred.org/imadethis/tinkerbell/">this similarly hilarious and out-of-date portfolio site</a>, which I should really take down, but I'm far too absorbed in my own personal history to do so.
