<a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2007/every-freelancer-ought-to-publish-a-weblog/">Point taken</a>.

I have hated the blog thing for so long, despite having spent a good deal of my formative years keeping online journals. But if I buckled to Facebook for the pursuit of fame and fortune, I can buckle to the weblog world.

That is, if I can actually do it consistently.
