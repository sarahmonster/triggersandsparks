For the past few months, I've been planning and plotting and getting myself excited about the prospect of another big trip. Those who know me are well aware of <a href="http://triggersandsparks.com/blog/a-vagabond-with-a-laptop-and-nice-shoes/">my fondness for travel</a>, and I haven't gone anywhere interesting (Ottawa doesn't count) for some time. I had big plans (South America, Death Valley, Mexico) that never materialized, for one reason or another, and I was <em>sure</em> that <em>this </em>was the one I'd be able to do.

As it turns out, it's not. Due to a variety of factors, I'm staying home. While this was a little crushing at first to realize (I was <em>so excited</em>!), I am choosing instead to approach it as an opportunity to enjoy the nice Halifax weather that's been happening lately (must be a cosmic fluke and/or the universe conspiring to send me thousands of tiny little signs that I should abandon my plans of abandonment) and to <strong>spend more time doing fun projects</strong>, which I almost invariably wouldn't be doing if I were on the road.

For starters, I'm finally going to invest the time and floorspace into setting up a proper workspace for myself, rather than just lounging on the couch all the time--I do miss having creative space (why oh <em>why</em> did I sell my drafting table at a yard sale for $15?) and things stuck all over my walls, and sometimes the entire upstairs of my apartment looks like it's been hit by a cyclone that carries nothing but paper scraps, bottles of ink, and empty cans of energy drinks.

<!--more-->At the beginning of the year, I made a<a href="http://triggersandsparks.com/blog/six-new-projects-for-2010/"> list of things I'd like to learn and try and experiment with</a>. I've lost steam a little bit of late, but I've already starting playing with a good number of these things: I took a <a href="http://triggersandsparks.com/blog/learning-from-loving-your-mistakes/">screenprinting class</a>; I learned calligraphy basics and <a href="http://triggersandsparks.com/blog/made-with-love-or-what-that-means-exactly/">produced a series of Valentines' cards</a>; I learned how to make books (although I still need to refine the process a touch before I'm genuinely happy with the results). I've also started on a number of new projects that are exciting and interesting, which is keeping me feeling fulfilled.

<strong>What I'd like to add to the list</strong>: more new and exciting projects, of course, and more self-directed work. I'd like to make an actual book--<em>Candide</em> will probably be my first candidate (hardy har)--which I'm rather excited about. I'd like to start designing some patterns again (I rather like designing my own damask) and applying them to fabrics/stationary products. I'd like to start doing regular typography assignments, just because I like playing with type. I'd like to work more with screenprinting and various hands-on methods of making stuff, and I'm looking into building my own letterpress, which I've wanted to do for <em>ages</em>. Ultimately, spending time doing the sort of work that doesn't necessarily generate money, but keeps me feeling creatively stimulated, will lead to me doing better work down the line.

So, while I was a touch crushed when I realized I wouldn't be able to go, I'm <em>determined</em> to turn it into a positive event in my life.

Spain, Morocco, and Iceland will probably still be there in the fall (right?). And in the meantime, perhaps I'll treat myself to a nice pair of shoes.
