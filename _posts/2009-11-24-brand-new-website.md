Ready, aim, FIRE! Consider yourself formally invited to the launch of my new website <a href="http://triggersandsparks.com">www.triggersandsparks.com</a>!

The new year is fast approaching, and <a href="http://triggersandsparks.com">Triggers &amp; Sparks</a> will be meeting it fresh-faced and bright-eyed.

A complete redesign of the old website was long overdue and now it's time to lay my beloved, but clunky, Ruby on Rails site to rest and move on to a faster, cleaner, more user friendly website. It's been three years since I designed my old website, and I've learned a great deal in that time, so it's about time I had a website to represent as much!

In keeping with the whole, "out with the old, in with the new" theme going on, and to celebrate the launch of <a href="http://triggersandsparks.com">triggersandsparks.com</a>, I am offering 15% off any of my services purchased between today and January 1st.

The times, they are a-changin' here at Triggers &amp; Sparks, and some fabulous top secret projects are in the works for the coming year. Get your orders in now and have yours be one of them!

Keep up with promotions and news by <a href="http://triggersandsparks.com/newsletter">signing up for the Triggers &amp; Sparks mailing list</a>, or <a href="http://twitter.com/sarahsemark">following me on Twitter</a>, or <a href="http://facebook.com/triggersandsparks">joining my Facebook fan page</a>, or <a href="http://triggersandsparks.com/feed">subscribing to my (new!)
