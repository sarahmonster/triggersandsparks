<p>I've finished the redesign of <a href="http://kisserup.com">kisserup.com</a>, and am now working on a business card and brochure. I'm also taking care of a brochure/business card combination for the <a href="http://walkerinn.com">Walker Inn</a>, which my mum bought a little while ago. I'm working on various smaller projects for the <a href="http://halifaxcranberry.com">Halifax Cranberry Company</a>, and am today starting on a revamp of the <a href="http://votedarian.ca">VoteDarian</a> website for a local provincial Liberal candidate, <a href="http://voteforrick.ca">Rick Welsford</a>. What does that mean? Yep, there's another election in the air! Naturally, I'm thrilled. The instability of Canadian government means that, since turning 18 four-odd years ago, I've voted in one provincial election and two federal. Last election night, I was so excited, I couldn't sleep, and spent most of the night refreshing the results on my browser in anticipation. Spring fever has most definitely hit, and I've got my energy back. Got a project for me? Now's a perfect time!</p>
