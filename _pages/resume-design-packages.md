<p class="cap">Great design isn't all websites and logos, nor is it for businesses only. If you're looking to launch a career or land your dream job, great design will help you get a foot in the door!</p>
Employers see hundreds (sometimes thousands) of resumes for just one job posting. No matter how brilliant your credentials are, without an eye-grabbing, creative, and relevant design, your application will <em>not</em> land you that interview.

My <a href="http://www.triggersandsparks.com/portfolio/resumes/">custom resumes</a> apply marketing, personal branding and design to the where, what, and when of your resume info to transform it into a resume that reflects your personality, industry and occupation.

<h2>You wouldn't wear a track suit to your interview, so why send out a shabby resume to get you a job?</h2>
For a limited time only I am offering a resume special—until March 30, 2010—on resume design services. For the price of a new pair of shoes, you can get a resume that will help you get your foot in the door to the job you want. Compared to a yearly salary, what's $150?

So stop asking the Lord to buy you a Mercedes Benz and get a professionally designed and totally unique resume in PDF form, perfect for either print or email.
