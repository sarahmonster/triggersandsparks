<p class="cap">When I get up in front of a group of people and start speaking, my brain stops working properly. I can't operate a computer. I forget words I used to know. I cling to the podium because I can't stop shaking. But I like doing things that terrify me, and I like figuring out how to get better at things I'm not great at.</p>

<h3>The Unbearable Likeness of Design (Wordcamp Brighton, July 2016)</h3>

Why do so many websites look the same? As our tools have improved and we’ve been able to do more with the web, there’s been a growing trend toward websites that look exactly alike. Why did this come to be, and what can we, as designers and curators of the modern web, do to avoid it?

In order to answer these questions, we’ll touch briefly on the history of web design, and examine how modern tools and practises have contributed to a more homogeneous-looking internet. We’ll examine the web design process from two perspectives – the designer’s and the developer’s – and discuss how the blurring of those roles impacts the design process. Along the way, we’ll discuss the various merits of following or bucking trends. Finally, I’ll offer some constructive advice to help you – whether you’re a designer or not – add an individual touch to your design work.

<h3>How I learned to stop using icon fonts (and love SVG). WordCamp London, April 2016</h3>
Once upon a time, icon fonts were the exciting new tools we used to build better websites. That time has passed, yet most of us are still relying on a tool that’s no longer relevant in the landscape of the modern web. In this talk, I’ll discuss the various merits of making the switch to SVG and some neat things you can do with SVG. We’ll touch on various use cases, and present some ideas for determining the workflow that’s best suited to your individual needs. We’ll provide some practical tips and tools for using SVG sprites more easily and efficiently in your work. We’ll also discuss ideas for implementing SVG within WordPress themes and plugins in a simple, consistent manner. Along the way, we’ll discuss various challenges you may encounter, and how to approach them. By the time we’re done, you’ll be fully armed to start using SVG today!

<h3>I Broke Up with Photoshop—And You Can Too! (WordCamp Montreal 2014)</h3>

This presentation talks about getting out of the Photoshop mindset, embracing the tools that the modern web has provided us in order to streamline our development practises and get real-live sites up and running fast. We’ll start with talking about how to use style tiles to reduce the amount of time spent on mockups, and then we’ll move on to discuss how to leverage available tools in order to quickly get a site running: skeleton themes, CSS precompilers, version control for quick deployment, icon fonts, browser development tools, grids, and CSS frameworks. <a href="/slides/photoshop">Slides.</a>

<h3>How to build a website on the moon (WordCamp Montreal 2013)</h3>
[wpvideo PR18d8M9]
Frustrated with building WordPress sites? I’ve been there. Travelling, I often find myself with unreliable internet, and I realized that my development process needed an overhaul. So, late one night working with the geckos in Cambodia, I set about optimizing the process. After a great deal of trial and error, I developed a series of tools that will allow anyone to better manage their WordPress development practices. <a href="/slides/moon">Slides.</a>
