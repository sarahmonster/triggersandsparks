I'm not a great public speaker. Honestly, when I get up in front of a group of people and start speaking, my brain stops working correctly. I can't operate my computer correctly. I forget words I usually know. I generally cling to the podium because I can't stop shaking.

But I like doing things that terrify me, and I like figuring out how to get better at things I'm not great at.

Also, it feels really great when it's over.
