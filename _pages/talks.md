<p class="cap">I'm not a great public speaker. Honestly, when I get up in front of a group of people and start speaking, my brain stops working correctly. I can't operate my computer correctly. I forget words I usually know. I generally cling to the podium because I can't stop shaking.</p>
But I like doing things that terrify me, and I like figuring out how to get better at things I'm not great at.

Also, it feels really great when it's over.

<h2>Past talks</h2>
<h3>The Unbearable Likeness of Design (WordPress Montreal meetup, November 2015)</h3>

Why do so many websites look the same? In order to answer this question, we’ll first look at trends in web design over its short history, and examine how modern tools and practises have contributed to a more homogenous-looking internet. We’ll examine the web design process from two perspectives—the designer’s and the developer’s—and discuss how the blurring of those roles impacts design. Along the way, we’ll discuss the various merits of following or bucking trends. Finally, we’ll offer some constructive advice to help you—whether you’re a designer or not—add an individual touch to your design work. <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/sarahmonster/the-unbearable-likeness-of-web-design">Slides.</a>

<h3>I Broke Up with Photoshop—And You Can Too! (WordCamp Montreal 2014)</h3>

This presentation talks about getting out of the Photoshop mindset, embracing the tools that the modern web has provided us in order to streamline our development practises and get real-live sites up and running fast. We’ll start with talking about how to use style tiles to reduce the amount of time spent on mockups, and then we’ll move on to discuss how to leverage available tools in order to quickly get a site running: skeleton themes, CSS precompilers, version control for quick deployment, icon fonts, browser development tools, grids, and CSS frameworks. <a href="/slides/photoshop">Slides.</a>

<h3>How to build a website on the moon (WordCamp Montreal 2013)</h3>
[wpvideo PR18d8M9]
Frustrated with building WordPress sites? I’ve been there. Travelling, I often find myself with unreliable internet, and I realized that my development process needed an overhaul. So, late one night working with the geckos in Cambodia, I set about optimizing the process. After a great deal of trial and error, I developed a series of tools that will allow anyone to better manage their WordPress development practices. <a href="/slides/moon">Slides.</a>
