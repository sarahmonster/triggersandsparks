<p class="cap">Hi there! I'm Sarah. I'm a designer, a (semi) reformed partygirl, and an incorrigible nomad. In my spare time, I like to paint things, play tennis, and ride motorbikes. I like wine, but I'm not weird about it: I just think it's tasty. I tend toward run-on sentences both in writing and in speaking, and I almost always wear skirts.</p>

This is my website. Once upon a time, it was my business website, but now it is just a collection of scattered stories. Most of them are about travel. Some of them are about design. Some of them are about other stuff. They're usually ridiculously long and sporadically posted. 

I spend a lot of my money on plane tickets. I've been to [wanderlist-location show=countries] different countries over the years, and I have a never-ending list of new places I'd like to go. (This very instant, I'm exploring [wanderlist-location show=current].)

<p class="cap">For eight years, I ran a freelance design business while I skittered across the globe. Most of the stories here are from then, although you can't tell by my liberal usage of curse words and total inability to relate stories to anything business-y. I now work for <a href="http://automattic.com">Automattic</a>, making themes for <a href="http://wordpress.com">WordPress.com</a>. You may have heard of us if you've ever made a blog or a website.</p>

This is a work in progress.
